The **Mines Digital Trust POC** was initiated by the BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation to support:

- **producers of consumer goods and purchasers of mineral resources** in proving responsible sourcing;
- **government** in exploring the community effort to establish a digital trust ecosystem for finding, issuing, storing, and sharing trustworthy data via verifiable credentials.

For this effort, our team has built 2 open-source common services by leveraging common components:

## Service I - Issuing Verifiable Credentials to OrgBook BC

This common service enables the issuance of verifiable credentials to [OrgBook BC](https://www.orgbook.gov.bc.ca/en/home), starting from verifiable credentials for Mines Act Permits, and verifiable credentials for related observable data metrics such as Annual GHG Emissions of a mine site. To learn more, please see: [Issuing Verifiable Credentials to OrgBook BC](./ISSUER_AGENT.md).

### Components:

- [Trust Over IP stack](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0289-toip-stack)
  - Issuer Agent - handling all of the Aries agent type functions (e.g. messages, protocols, protocol state, agent storage, etc.)
  - Issuer Controller - providing the business logic that gives the agent personality
  - [Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python)
  - Client API Wrapper
- [Aries Verifiable Credentials Registry Instance (OrgBook BC)]( https://github.com/bcgov/aries-vcr)

## Service II - Business to Business Credential Manager

The **Business to Business Credential Manager (BBCM)** is software run by an organization for issuing, holding, and verifying digital trust credentials. Powered by [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/), with BBCM organizations can share and receive proofs that are secure and verifiable. Want to become an early adopter? To learn more, please see: [Business to Business Credential Manager](./BBCM.md).

### Components:

- [Business Partner Agent](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent)
  - Connection Manager - For establishing connection between 2 Business Partner Agents
  - Credential Manager - For tracking and managing credentials
  - Proof Manager - For tracking and managing proof requests and presentations
  - Attestation Manager
  - Profile Manager - For managing organizational profiles
- [Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python)
- [Verifiable Credential Authentication with OpenID Connect](https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc(edited))
