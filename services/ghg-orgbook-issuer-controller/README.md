# Purpose

This service interacts with the ACA-py agent on behalf of the business application to issue credentias to [OrgBook](https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca/en/home). 

ghg-orgbook-issuer-controller has been configured to issue Annual GHG Emission Reports to the OrgBook. The intended consumer of this does not have a web application. Data can be published in batches by using our [ghg-issuer-tools](../ghg-issuer-tools)

# Credential

The configured credential attests that... The given business has self-reported the included Greenhouse Gas Emissions data for the included year and the data has been received by the Ministry of Environment & Climate Change Strategy.
