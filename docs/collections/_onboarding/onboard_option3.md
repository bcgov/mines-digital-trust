#### **For whom**
If your organization is internal to the BC Government and needs to issue, hold, and/or verify credentials, this option is suitable for you.

#### Coming soon
A self-service onboarding to the BC Government hosted Business to Business Credential Manager service has been planned out. Once enabled, this would allow business owners to set up without any development team required.
