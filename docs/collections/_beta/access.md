The **Business Partner Agent (BPA)** is software run by an organization for issuing, holding, and/or verifying [digital trust credentials](knowledge.html). Currently there are 2 ways to log into your organization's BPA. You can use your *IDIR Username & Password* if you work for the BC government, or a personal *Access Verifiable Credential (VC)* issued by us.

**Step 4. Scan the QR code from your personal wallet and accept the connection invitation.**
