So now you probably have granted [access](access.html) to your organization's Business Partner Agent (BPA). Not sure where to start? Don't worry, you will be equipped with necessary knowledge by learning some key concepts from the [Knowledge Center](knowledge.html). This guide below will also help you explore the features.

#### How to...?

- How to set up the **Public Profile** for your organization?
  - The Public Profile contains information (e.g. Company Legal Name, Company Alternate Name, Address, etc.) of your organization and is visible to your business partners/connections.
  - You can view and edit the information by navigating to the "Public Profile" page through the left vertical menu.

- How to **connect with another organization or individual**?
  - To perform transactions (e.g. issue verifiable credentials, send proof requests, etc.), you need to first be connected with the other organization or individual (i.e. become business partners/connections with each other).
  - You can view a list of your existing business partners/connections or initiate a new connection request/invitation by navigating to the "Business Partners" page through the left vertical menu.
  - To send a connection request, you start with looking up the other organization by its DID.
  - You can also generate a QR code as a connection invitation, and then send it externally (e.g. email, etc.) to the other organization.

- How to **get prepared for issuing verifiable credentials**?
  - A credential schema and a credential definition are required for issuing verifiable credentials.
  - You can create them by navigating to the "Credential Management" page through the left vertical menu.

- How to **issue a verifiable credential**?
  - Once you have the credential schema and credential definition in place (please see the above question if not), you can start issuing the verifiable credential on either the "Credential Management" page or the "Business Partners" page.
  - If you go to the "Credential Management" page, select the business partner/connection you want to issue to first, then select the credential schema, then fill in the attribute values, and you are ready to hit the "Issue Credential" button.
  - If you go to the "Business Partners" page, select the business partner/connection you want to issue to first, then on its details page, issue the credential by selecting the credential schema, then fill in the attribute values.
