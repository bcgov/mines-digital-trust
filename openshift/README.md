# Configure, Build, Deploy a Manual Pipeline
Due to the limited timeframe to get a Proof-of-Concept complete, we have forgone the time/effort investment in building an automated [CI/CD pipeline](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd).

**IMPORTANT:** Eensure that you read _all_ of the following files before you perform any of the actions described therein.

1. You have read through this document's parent [readme](./README.md)
1. [Setup required tools](./tooling.md)
1. [Initialize namespaces](./initialization.md)
1. [Generate parameters](./generated-params.md)
1. [First deployment](./first-deployments.md)
1. [Ongoing deployments](./ongoing-deployments.md)

Once you have read _all_ the documentation, and you have met the prerequisites for deployment, jump to where you need (most likely [Ongoing deployments](./ongoing-deployments.md)).
